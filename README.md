# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)

A powerful computer vision system that automatically detects and reads vehicle license plates from images or video streams. This system is designed for real-time traffic monitoring, parking management, and security applications.

## What This Project Does

- **Real-time Vehicle Detection**: Instantly identifies vehicles in images or video streams
- **License Plate Recognition**: Automatically locates and extracts license plate information
- **Text Reading**: Converts license plate images into readable text
- **Live Processing**: Works with both static images and live video feeds

## Key Applications

- Traffic monitoring and management
- Parking lot automation
- Security and surveillance systems
- Toll collection automation
- Law enforcement support
- Access control systems

## Technical Overview

Built with state-of-the-art technologies:
- YOLOv8 for accurate vehicle and plate detection
- EasyOCR for reliable text recognition
- OpenCV for efficient image processing
